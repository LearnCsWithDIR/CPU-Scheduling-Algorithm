# CPUschedulingAlgorithm
A multi-level queue scheduling algorithm with 4 queues (RR, SJF_1, SJF_2, FCFS) . Each queue should be given a time quantum of 20 seconds, and the CPU should switch between queues after every 20 seconds. The user should be prompted to enter the number of processes along with their priority associated with each queue.
